    <h1> History of Browsers </h1>
    <p> This is topic 1 </p>
    <!--<p> 
        In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the WorldWideWeb and it served as the first interactive “browser”. It allowed users to interact with the web servers efficiently while searching for information on the Internet. 
        Web browsers play a pivotal role in the way people interact online, whether it is researching new topics or communicating with others. Regardless of how they are used, browsers must be simple, functional, and private 
        in order for users to effectively use them. 
    </p> -->
    <p> <!-- The beginning of the Web -->
        After the development of the Web, many people became interested in tackling the challenge of technological innovation, leading to the creation of the “Mosaic” by the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) 
        in 1993 (GeeksforGeeks, 2023). It was the first browser that “demonstrated the use of multimedia (images) on the web” (GeeksforGeeks, 2023). The next year, Marc Andereessen released the Netscape Navigator, which 
        quickly became popular to the masses (GeeksforGeeks, 2023). To compete against Netscape’s popularity, Microsoft developed their browser, Internet Explorer. Thus, the browser wars began as they pushed to surpass 
        each other, and other browsers such as Firefox, Safari, and Chrome sprang up to compete for popularity. 
    </p>
    <p> <!-- IE + Edge Intro -->
        However, as the browsers gained fame amongst their users for their positive user experience, Internet Explorer saw a decline in its popularity. Users criticized Internet Explorer for its “sluggish performance” and
         “compatibility issues” that worsened their user experience (Hondrade). That was not Internet Explorer’s only issue. The pressure Microsoft felt from its competitors hindered the company from being able to fix
         Internet Explorer’s security issues (Hondrade). All of these factors eventually lead to the discontinuation of Internet Explorer in 2015. Microsoft released Edge as its successor, with new features and improved website 
         compatibility to fix its predecessor’s failures. With a clean slate, Microsoft Edge was finally able to compete on even ground with the other browsers.
    </p>
    <p> <!-- Firefox Intro -->
        Firefox began as the Mozilla project in 1998 when Netscape became an open-source code (“History of the Mozilla Project”). The Mozilla project blossomed with passion as developers came onboard and contributed in 
        “creating free software that would enable people to have a choice in how they experienced the internet” (“History of the Mozilla Project”). In 2004, Firefox was officially released and disrupted Internet Explorer’s monopoly 
        over the browser industry. Many people were excited to have a new browser option to choose from and thus transitioned from Internet Explorer to Firefox. Plus, seeing how its priority on functionality and security made it 
        continue to grow in popularity. Firefox introduced browsing with tabs and incorporated built-in pop-up blockers (Mozilla, 2024). Over time, Firefox would continue to update and implement new features to stay relevant in 
        the browser wars.
    </p>
    <p> <!-- Google Intro -->
        Although Chrome entered the browser wars much later than the others, to this day, it still remains at the top. It was released in 2008 using Chromium’s open-source code, one of Google’s other projects, and developers
         that worked on Internet Explorer and Firefox (Studysection, 2019). This cumulative effort to create a new, flawless browser resulted in millions of users flooding to Chrome. Especially with the development of mobile 
         devices, Chrome continued to stay relevant with users as Google developed Chrome applications that were compatible with Android and iOS devices (Studysection, 2019). Chrome continues to sit at the top spot amongst 
         the other browsers due to continuous updates with incredible speed and security. It is the browser that perfectly fits everyone’s needs.

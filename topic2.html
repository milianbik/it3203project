    <h1> How Browsers Work </h1>
    <p> This is topic 2 </p> <!-- link to key concepts page about vocab-->

        Regardless of which browser is used, they all work to render HTML and CSS on the computer screen and provide an interactive interface 
        that is easy to understand and runs smoothly to pull up the websites from web servers. Browsers are meant to interpret certain specifications as defined by the W3C, which Berners-Lee founded, in order to maintain 
        website compatibility (Irish and Garsiel, 2011). From the front end, browsers all function similarly with a homepage, forward and backward buttons, a refresh button, and an address bar, but they can vary in the way they 
        load websites or store cookies (Irish and Garsiel, 2011). Since different browsers can have different rendering engines, a website can load on-screen with a slightly different look than on other browsers. However, in general, 
        rendering engines work by constructing a render tree to illustrate the relationship between the different HTML elements in the code for the website (Rajora). After the pieces are set in place, it gets rendered and loads 
        onto the computer screen as the full web page.

        Browsers also work with search engines to ease users’ ability to find content on the Internet. Search engines help to compile relevant information based on the user’s input that they can click on, which the browser 
        then opens. Search engines work by crawlers that scan websites and indexes them with keywords so that when a user searches, they will be given a list of sites that match the inputted search (GeekforGeeks, 2025). 
        Although browsers do not need to have search engines, they come as a pair so enhance the user experience. So, when opening a browser such as Chrome or Edge, the accompanying search engines Google and Bing 
        open as well. Additionally, with the development of mobile devices, browsers need to accommodate for the smaller screens and different forms of interface interactions compared to their desktop counterparts. Even 
        though mobile devices compensate functionality for clean website designs and data-saving browsers, they do still miss out on the flexibility of features and multitasking capabilities (Mirror Review, 2025).

        In addition, browsers also need a way to store information pertaining to the user. A browser does this using cache and cookies. Known as “data persistence,” holding onto this information about the user helps to 
        improve browser functionality and user experience (Rajora). In this way, a user can save their password for a certain website and not need to log in again or revisit a website from their browsing history. However, this
        raises a security concern as private information could be leaked. As a way to address this issue, many browsers have an incognito or private browsing mode. It helps to delete cookies and blocks third-parties from 
        tracking cookies, however, it does not entirely guarantee privacy while online, especially since Internet service providers always have access to that information (“Incognito Browser”). Interestingly, the Tor browser 
        functions to entirely cover up browsing activity by “[bouncing] traffic through multiple servers around the globe” (“Incognito Browser”). Furthermore, browsers can also function as it does in North Korea. The government
         allows the citizens intranet access through its browser Naenara and from there only certain government approved websites can be accessed (Johnson, 2021). The North Korean Naenara is based on Mozilla Firefox’s 
         open-source code and functions much like a “Korean language version of Firefox” (Johnson, 2021). However, the people do not have the freedom to access the global Internet and are restricted in the websites they can
          access, since their intranet functions as a “walled garden” (Johnson, 2021).

        The future of browsers looks forward to improving security of users’ private information and adding new features to enhance the user experience. Especially since COVID, many companies have moved their services
         online, so they need to be able to not only protect their customers’ private information, but also their own private information that is stored for business purposes. Improved data security, threat protection, and 
         centralized IT management are all key features that future browsers can adopt to better protect companies online (Krysinska, 2025). With cyberattacks a regular occurrence, businesses need to be protected from any 
         possible attacks, so I think that it is possible for browsers to head towards increased protections of information. Additionally, the increased development and use of artificial intelligence is leading browsers towards a 
         route of AI assistants. Currently, Microsoft Edge already has their Copilot and Google Chrome has Gemini. In the near future, artificial intelligence may find more spaces to occupy in browsers to enhance user experience. 
         However, the question arises concerning the possibility of artificial intelligence’s invasiveness. In order to provide the best experience for users, artificial intelligence might be programmed to inspect browsing and other 
         online behaviors in order to give users the most personalization, but when does that become a form of censorship? If browsers and search algorithms become too personalized, web usage could result in seeing the topics
          that users are familiar with, resulting in limited exposure to new and different things.
